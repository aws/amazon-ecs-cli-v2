//
// AWS Fusion is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective
// way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running
// service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies,
// decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure
// AWS resources.
//
// Fusion connects directly to your container registry or source code repository.
// It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully-managed operations,
// high performance, scalability, and security.
//
// For more information about Fusion, see the AWS Fusion Developer Guide (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fusion/latest/dg/).
// For release information, see the AWS Fusion Release Notes (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fusion/latest/relnotes/).
//
// The latest Fusion WSDL is located at TBD (TBD). To install the Software Development
// Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command
// line tools that enable you to access the API, see Tools for Amazon Web Services
// (http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).
//
// Endpoints
//
// For a list of region-specific endpoints that Fusion supports, see AWS Fusion
// endpoints and quotas (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/fusion.html)
// in the AWS General Reference.

//
// Using the Client
//
// To contact AWS Bullet with the SDK use the New function to create
// a new service client. With that client you can make API requests to the service.
// These clients are safe to use concurrently.
//
// See the SDK's documentation for more information on how to use the SDK.

// See aws.Config documentation for more information on configuring SDK clients.
