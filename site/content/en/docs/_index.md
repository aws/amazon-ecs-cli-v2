Welcome to the Copilot CLI ðŸŽ‰

The Copilot CLI is a tool for developers to develop, release, and operate production ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS. From getting started, pushing to staging and releasing to production, Copilot can help manage the entire lifecycle of your application development.

This site contains descriptions and examples of different commands as well as descriptions of the infrastructure that we'll spin up on your behalf.
